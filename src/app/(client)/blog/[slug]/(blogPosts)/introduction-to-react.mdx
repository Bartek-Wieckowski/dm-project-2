# Introduction to React

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.

## Why React?

- **Component-Based**: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
- **Declarative**: React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application.
- **Learn Once, Write Anywhere**: You can develop new features in React without rewriting existing code.

### Getting Started

To create a new React application, you can use the Create React App tool:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
